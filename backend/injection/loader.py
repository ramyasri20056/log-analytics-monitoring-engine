#parsing the data
#structure the data and load the data using injection files
#parser: parser is a python method which is used to convert the raw data into structured data based on 
# the schema which we have defined(translater)
#without parser:no columns are defined 
#no filtering is done
#no anamoloy is detection or no aggregation
#with parsing: we can filter error logs
#detect the unsual patterns
#it converts raw log data to the machine readable language
